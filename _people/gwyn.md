Gwynnevere is a first year Psychology PhD student funded by the College of Live and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham. Her project focuses on identifying mechanistic relationships and differences between dissociation and psychosis. To do this, Gwynnevere uses self-monitoring memory tests, fMRI, and computational modelling across clinical and non-clinical groups. She is also a representative for the Psychology postgraduate research students at the university level and is working with Dr Emma ÄŒernis on a pilot randomised control trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for dissociation.
