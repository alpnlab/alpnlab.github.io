Anne completed her PhD at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. She is interested in the neural bases of prosocial behavior. By adopting a neuro-computational approach and applying mathematical modelling techniques, she wants to understand what neural and behavioral processes foster or hinder prosocial behavior. In this vein, she uses different neural (fMRI, EEG) and behavioral (mouse-tracking, experience sampling, reaction time experiments) methods.
